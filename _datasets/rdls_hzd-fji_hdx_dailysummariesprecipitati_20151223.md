description: 'This dataset contains the daily summaries on base stations across Fiji
  . The four indicators included are: * TPCP : Total precipitation * MXSD : Maximum
  snow depth * TSNW : Total snow fall * EMXP : Extreme maximum daily precipitation
  Indicators are compiled by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
  which is administrated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
  an organization part of the United States government. NOAA has access to data collected
  from thousands of base stations around the world, which collect data periodically
  on weather and climate conditions. This dataset contains the latest 5 years of available
  data .. [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian
  Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/daily-summaries-of-precipitation-indicators-for-fiji]'
details: Due to late-arriving data, the number of recent records is likely underrepresented
  in all categories, but the ratio of records (warm to cold, for example) should be
  a fairly strong estimate of a final outcome.

  description: Daily precipitation data were collected from meteorological base stations
    across Fiji by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Stations
    were selected based on a 30-year minimum record requirement with at least 182
    complete days per year. Four precipitation indicators (total precipitation, maximum
    snow depth, total snowfall, extreme maximum daily precipitation) were compiled
    into daily summaries for drought and precipitation monitoring.
