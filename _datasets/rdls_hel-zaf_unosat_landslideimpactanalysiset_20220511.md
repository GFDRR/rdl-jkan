description: 'UNOSAT code: FL20220418ZAF Landslide impact analysis in eThekwini, Metropolitan
  Municipality, This map illustrates satellite-detected water and landslides/mudflow
  in eThekwini, Metropolitan Municipality, eThekwini District, KwaZulu-Natal Province,
  South Africa as observed from a WorldView-3 image acquired on 20 April 2022. Within
  the analyzed area, 323 ha of landslide scars were observed. Based on Worldpop population
  data, about 570,000 people live inside the analyzed area. Within the analysis extent,
  UNITAR-UNOSAT identified 164 damaged/affeted structures and 79 potentially damaged
  structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the
  field. Please send ground feedback to the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT)..
  [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian
  Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/landslide-impact-analysis-in-ethekwini-metropolitan-municipality-kwazulu-natalprovince-sou]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

    20 April 2022 with reference imagery to detect landslide scars and mudflow features
    through visual interpretation. Population exposure was estimated by overlaying
    WorldPop gridded population data with the analyzed area. Damaged structures were
    identified through satellite image analysis and counted within the impact zone.
