  description: EM-DAT aggregates post-event disaster impact data from multiple international
    sources including UN agencies, national governments, and media reports. This country
    profile for Oman compiles historical natural hazard events with recorded impacts
    (deaths, affected populations, economic damage) organized by disaster type and
    year, providing a retrospective loss registry rather than prospective hazard or
    exposure modeling.
