description: 'This dataset contains dekadal rainfall indicators, computed from Climate
  Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation satellite imagery with insitu Station data
  (CHIRPS) version 2 and the CHIRPS-GEFS short term rainfall forecasts, aggregated
  by subnational administrative units. Included indicators are (for each dekad): 10
  day rainfall [mm] ( rfh ) rainfall 1-month rolling aggregation [mm] ( r1h ) rainfall
  3-month rolling aggregation [mm] ( r3h ) rainfall long term average [mm] ( rfh_avg
  ) rainfall 1-month rolling aggregation long term average [mm] ( r1h_avg ) rainfall
  3-month rolling aggregation long term average [mm] ( r3h_avg ) rainfall anomaly
  [%] ( rfq ) rainfall 1-month anomaly [%] ( r1q ) rainfall 3-month anomaly [%] (
  r3q ) The administrative units used for aggregation are based on WFP data and contain
  a Pcode reference attributed to each unit. The number of input pixels used to create
  the aggregates, is provided in the n_pixels column. Finally, the type column indicates
  if the value is based on a forecast, a preliminary or a final product. Forecasts
  are issued on the 6th, 16th, and 26th of each month for the upcoming 10-day period
  (dekad), then updated with improved versions on the 1st, 11th, and 21st. Preliminary
  observations replace the previous dekad''s forecast on the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd,
  and are later replaced by final observations-published mid-month (13th or 23rd)-covering
  all three dekads of the prior month. Please find a summary below: Publication Day:
  Forecast type, Covers (Dekad) 1st: Updated forecast, 1-10 of the same month 6th:
  Initial forecast, 11-20 of the same month 11th: Updated forecast, 1-10 of the same
  month 16th: Initial forecast, 21-end of the same month 21st: Updated forecast, 11-20
  of the same month 26th: Initial forecast, 1-10 of the following month For more on
  CHIRPS-GEFS forecasts, see: https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps-gefs For further
  details, please see the methodology section.. [Source: This metadata record was
  automatically extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset:

details: To provide real-time data, the prelim version is used which then gets replaced
  successively by final data as it becomes available. For more information about differences
  between prelim and final see [CHIRPS Reality Checks](https://wiki.chc.ucsb.edu/CHIRPS_Reality_Checks).
  Forecast data is successively replaced by preliminary and final data.
