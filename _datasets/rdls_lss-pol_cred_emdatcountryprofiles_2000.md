  description: EM-DAT aggregates historical disaster event records from multiple sources
    (government agencies, UN bodies, NGOs, media) into a standardized registry. This
    country profile dataset presents compiled impact statistics (total affected, deaths,
    economic damage) for Poland stratified by disaster type and year, derived from
    the main EM-DAT database.
