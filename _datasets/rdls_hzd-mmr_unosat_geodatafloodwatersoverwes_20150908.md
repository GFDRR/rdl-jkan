description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in western Sagaing
  Division in the areas of Homalin, Tamu, Phaungbyin and Mawlaik townships of Myanmar
  as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 4 September 2015. Waters along the Chindwin
  have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank and as of 4
  September 2015 a total of ~111,000 ha of lands were affected. Total surface area
  covered with water in the analysed area has increased from a pre-flood level of
  0.4% to 2.9 % during the flood period. This is a preliminary analysis and has not
  yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT..

  Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geodata-of-flood-waters-over-western-sagaing-division-myanmar-september-08-2015]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts compared pre-flood and flood-period Sentinel-1 satellite
    imagery acquired on 4 September 2015 to detect and delineate flood water extent
    across western Sagaing Division. Water surface area was quantified as polygon
    geometries with area calculations in hectares, showing expansion from 0.4% to
    2.9% of the study area.
