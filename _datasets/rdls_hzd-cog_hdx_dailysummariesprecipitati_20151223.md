description: 'This dataset contains the daily summaries on base stations across Congo
  . The four indicators included are: * TPCP : Total precipitation * MXSD : Maximum
  snow depth * TSNW : Total snow fall * EMXP : Extreme maximum daily precipitation
  Indicators are compiled by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
  which is administrated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
  an organization part of the United States government. NOAA has access to data collected
  from thousands of base stations around the world, which collect data periodically
  on weather and climate conditions. This dataset contains the latest 5 years of available
  data .. [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian
  Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/daily-summaries-of-precipitation-indicators-for-congo]'
details: Due to late-arriving data, the number of recent records is likely underrepresented
  in all categories, but the ratio of records (warm to cold, for example) should be
  a fairly strong estimate of a final outcome.

  description: Daily precipitation and snow measurements were collected from weather
    stations across Congo by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.
    Stations were filtered to include only those with at least 30 years of continuous
    records with >182 days of data per year. Four precipitation-related indicators
    (total precipitation, maximum snow depth, total snowfall, extreme maximum daily
    precipitation) were compiled into daily summaries for meteorological drought monitoring.
