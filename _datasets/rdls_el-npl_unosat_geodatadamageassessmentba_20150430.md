description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the
  municipality of Banepa, Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Located about 25 kilometers east
  of Kathmandu city, Banepa experienced some damage as a result of the 25 April 2015
  earthquake. Using satellite imagery acquired 27 April 2015 UNITAR / UNOSAT identified
  a total of 20 affected structures. Approximately 4 of these were destroyed, 12 severely
  damaged, and 4 moderately damaged. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet
  been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.. [Source:
  This metadata record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange
  (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geodata-of-damage-assessment-of-banepa-kathmandu-valley-nepal-april-30-2015]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts reviewed satellite imagery acquired 27 April 2015,
    comparing it with pre-event imagery to detect structural damage from the 25 April
    2015 earthquake. Building structures were classified into damage categories (destroyed,
    severely damaged, moderately damaged) through visual interpretation of satellite-detected
    changes. This preliminary analysis identified 20 affected structures without field
    validation.
