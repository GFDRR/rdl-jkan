  description: Post-event disaster loss data compiled from direct observational records
    and anecdotal reports collected by UNISDR and Indonesia Government Agencies. Data
    includes recorded impacts from climate-related hazards (primarily flood and drought
    events) across Indonesia, with metrics covering human casualties, displacement,
    housing damage, and agricultural losses. The dataset integrates multiple government
    agency reports into a unified loss inventory for disaster risk assessment.
