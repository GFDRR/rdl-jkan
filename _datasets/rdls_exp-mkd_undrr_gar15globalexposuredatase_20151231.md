description: 'The GAR15 global exposure database is based on a top-down approach where
  statistical information including socio-economic, building type, and capital stock
  at a national level are transposed onto the grids of 5x5 or 1x1 using geographic
  distribution of population data and gross domestic product (GDP) as proxies.. [Source:
  This metadata record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange
  (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/gar15-global-exposure-dataset-for-macedonia-the-former-yugoslav-republic-of]'
details: This dataset was generated using other global datasets; it should not be
  used for local applications (such as land use planning). The main purpose of GAR
  2015 datasets is to broadly identify high risk areas at global level and for identification
  of areas where more detailed data should be collected. Some areas may be underestimated
  or overestimated. Given this analysis was conducted using global datasets, the resolution
  of which is not sufficient for in-situ planning, it should not be used for critical
  (like life saving) decisions. UNISDR and collaborators should in no case be liable
  for misuse or misinterpretation of the presented results. The designations employed
  and the presentation of material on the maps do not imply the expression of any
  opinion whatsoever on the part of UNISDR or the Secretariat of the United Nations
  concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities,
  or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Please refer to the

  archive for additional important information and metadata.

  description: National-level socio-economic and building stock statistics were transposed
    onto 5x5 km and 1x1 km spatial grids using geographic population distribution
    and GDP as spatial proxies. The GAR15 global exposure database was developed by
    UNEP-GRID in collaboration with WAPMERR, EU JRC, and Kokusai Kogyo to create a
    spatially-explicit inventory of economic assets and population exposure for disaster
    risk assessment.
