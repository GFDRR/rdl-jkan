description: 'UNOSAT code: FL20210630NPL This map illustrates satellite-detected surface
  waters in Province 1, Nepal as observed from a Sentinel-1 image acquired on 4 July
  2021 at 05:48 local time and using an automated analysis with Machine learning method.
  Within the analyzed area of 4,060 km2, about 240 km2 of lands appear to be flooded.
  The water extent appears to have decreased of about 200 km2 since 1 July 2021 and
  moved toward India. Based on Worldpop population data and the detected surface waters
  in the analyzed area, the potentially exposed population is mainly located in the
  district of Sunsari with ~186,000 people, Morang with ~83,600 people, and Jhapa
  with ~21,700 people. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated
  in the field. Please send ground feedback to United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT).
  Important note: Flood analysis from radar images may underestimate the presence
  of standing waters in built-up areas and densely vegetated areas due to backscattering
  properties of the radar signal.. [Source: This metadata record was automatically
  extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/satellite-detected-water-extent-over-province-1-nepal-as-of-4-july-2021]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: Sentinel-1 SAR imagery from 4 July 2021 was processed using automated
    machine learning methods to detect surface water extent across 4,060 km2 in Province
    1, Nepal. Detected water polygons (240 km2) were intersected with WorldPop population
    grids to estimate potentially exposed population. Change detection compared to
    1 July 2021 imagery quantified flood extent reduction of approximately 200 km2.
