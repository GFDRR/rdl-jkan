description: 'UNOSAT code: TC20211216PHL This map illustrates potentially damaged
  structures and buildings in Bien Unido, Trinidad and Ubay municipalities, Bohol
  province, Region VII (Central Visayas), Philippines as observed from a Pleiades
  image acquired on 23 December 2021. Within the analyzed area, UNOSAT identified
  2,225 damaged structures and 888 potentially damaged structures. This is a preliminary
  analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback
  to UNITAR-UNOSAT.. [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from
  the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/damage-assessment-in-bien-unido-trinidad-ubay-municipalities-bohol-province-philippines-as]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts reviewed Pleiades satellite imagery acquired on 23
    December 2021 and compared it with reference imagery to identify structural damage
    in three municipalities of Bohol Province following Typhoon Odette. Damaged and
    potentially damaged structures were manually delineated and counted, producing
    a preliminary post-event damage assessment dataset without field validation.
