description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected potential damaged structures
  in Chone area in Manabi Province, Ecuador, located at approximately 120 km south
  of the 16 April 2016 Muisne earthquake main shock epicentre. Using a Pleiades satellite
  image acquired the 19 April 2016 and a WorldView-2 image acquired the 02 December
  2013, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified 162 potentially damaged structures of which 62
  were destroyed, 36 severely damaged, and 64 moderately damaged. This is a preliminary
  analysis and not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to
  UNITAR - UNOSAT.. [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from
  the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geodata-of-damage-assessment-of-chone-area-manabi-province-ecuador-april-25-2016]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts compared pre-event (2 December 2013) and post-event
    (19 April 2016) satellite imagery of the Chone area to detect structural damage
    from the 16 April 2016 Muisne earthquake. Damaged structures were classified into
    three categories (destroyed, severely damaged, moderately damaged) based on visual
    interpretation of satellite-detected changes, producing a preliminary field-unvalidated
    assessment of 162 potentially damaged buildings.
