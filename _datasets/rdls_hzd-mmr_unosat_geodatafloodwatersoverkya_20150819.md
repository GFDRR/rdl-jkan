description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters over north Rakhine
  State, Myanmar, in the areas of Kyauktaw and Ponnagyun and Rathedaung townships,
  as imaged by the Radarsat-2 satellite on 17 August 2015. Waters along the Kaladan
  River have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank. Total
  surface area covered with water in the analysed area has increased from a pre-flood
  level of 4% to 8% during the flood period, and as of 17 August 2015 a total of ~55,000
  ha of lands were affected. Due to sensor limitations, flood waters could be underestimated
  in urban areas and areas covered with vegetation. This is a preliminary analysis
  and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT..

  Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geodata-of-flood-waters-over-kyautaw-area-rakhine-state-myanmar-august-19-2015]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts processed Radarsat-2 satellite imagery acquired on
    17 August 2015, comparing pre-flood and flood-period images to detect changes
    in water surface extent. Flood waters were classified and mapped as vector polygons
    with area calculations (55,000 ha total affected area identified). The dataset
    represents observed flood extent at a single point in time during the 2015 Myanmar
    flooding event.
