description: 'The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)
  project is the most complete global collection of tropical cyclones available. It
  merges recent and historical tropical cyclone data from multiple agencies to create
  a unified, publicly available, best-track dataset that improves inter-agency comparisons.
  Fields available: SID: A unique storm identifier (SID) assigned by IBTrACS algorithm.
  ISO_TIME: Time of the observation in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) BASIN: Basin
  of the current storm position SUBBASIN: Sub-basin of the current storm position
  NATURE: Type of storm (a combination of the various types from the available sources)
  NUMBER: Number of the storm for the year (restarts at 1 for each year LAT: Mean
  position - latitude (a combination of the available positions) LON: Mean position
  - longitude (a combination of the available positions) WMO_WIND: Maximum sustained
  wind speed assigned by the responsible WMO agency WMO_PRES: Minimum central pressure
  assigned by the responsible WMO agency.. [Source: This metadata record was automatically
  extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/gib-ibtracs-tropical-storm-tracks]'
details: 'Some early (pre-1950) storms were not correctly matched, so the number of
  storms in the record is artificially high. For example, SIO storms in 1901 are not
  matched, so the same storm is tracked by the following identifiers: ds824, td9636,
  and reunion. This storm is broken into different tracks because of temporal differences
  in the storm data.'

  description: IBTrACS integrates tropical cyclone observations from multiple national
    meteorological agencies into a unified best-track dataset. The data includes standardized
    measurements of wind speed (wmo_wind) and pressure (wmo_pres) at observed storm
    positions and times, processed through the IBTrACS algorithm to assign unique
    storm identifiers and resolve inter-agency discrepancies.
