  description: EM-DAT aggregates disaster event records from multiple international
    sources including UN agencies, national governments, and media reports. This Nepal
    country profile extracts and summarizes historical impact data (affected populations,
    deaths, economic damage) by disaster type and year from the main EM-DAT registry,
    providing a national-level loss assessment across multiple natural hazards.
