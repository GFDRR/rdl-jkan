description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the central
  part of Sagaing region in the areas of Shwebo, Wetlet and Khin-U townships of Myanmar
  as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 11 August 2015. Waters along the Mu River
  have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank. Floods affected
  lands increased on the left bank of the Mu River (downstream). Total surface area
  covered with water in the analysed area has increased from a pre-flood level of
  1% to 7% during the flood period, and as of 11 August 2015 a total of ~250,000 ha
  of lands were affected. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated
  in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT.. [Source: This metadata
  record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original
  dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geodata-of-flood-waters-over-central-sagaing-region-myanmar-august-13-2015]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts compared pre-flood and post-flood Sentinel-1 satellite
    imagery acquired on 11 August 2015 to detect and delineate flood water extent
    in the Mu River floodplain. Inundated areas were digitized and quantified by surface
    area (ha) to characterize the spatial distribution and magnitude of observed fluvial
    flooding.
