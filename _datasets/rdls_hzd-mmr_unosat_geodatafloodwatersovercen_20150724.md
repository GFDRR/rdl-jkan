description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the centre of
  Sagaiang State in the areas of Kawlin, Kanbalu, Taze and Kyunhla Townships of Myanmar
  as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 18 July 2015 and compared with waters imaged
  by Landsat-8 satellite and acquired 29 April 2015. Heavy rains at the onset of the
  monsoon season have caused flooding and an expansion of the dam reservoir close
  to Kanbalu town. Waters extended to about 80% in the area covered by the map and
  this includes the expansion of the dam reservoir. However the dam reservoir does
  not seem to be overflowing as of the 18 July 2015. Note also, many of inundated
  areas are swamps which are regularly flooded in the rainy season and as the river
  expands. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.
  Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT.. [Source: This metadata record was
  automatically extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset:

details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts compared Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired 18 July
    2015 with Landsat-8 baseline imagery from 29 April 2015 to detect and delineate
    flood water extent across Kawlin, Kanbalu, Taze and Kyunhla Townships. Flood polygons
    were digitized from satellite-detected water bodies, including dam reservoir expansion,
    with confidence levels and validation flags recorded for each feature.
