description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the
  Hansapur area of Nepal. Located roughly seven and a half to twelve kilometers west
  of the 25 April 2015 earthquake epicenter, the Hansapur area was significantly impacted
  by this event. Using satellite imagery acquired 29 April 2015 UNITAR / UNOSAT identified
  a total of 145 affected structures in this area. Approximately 33 of these were
  destroyed, 47 severely damaged, and 65 moderately damaged. This is a preliminary
  analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback
  to UNITAR / UNOSAT.. [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from
  the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geodata-of-damage-assessment-of-hansapur-area-western-region-nepal-may-05-2015]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts compared satellite imagery acquired 29 April 2015 with
    pre-event imagery to detect structural damage in the Hansapur area, 7.5-12 km
    west of the earthquake epicenter. Buildings were classified into three damage
    categories (destroyed, severely damaged, moderately damaged) through visual interpretation
    of satellite-detected changes. This preliminary assessment was not field-validated.
