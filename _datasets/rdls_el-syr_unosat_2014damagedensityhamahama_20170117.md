description: 'This map illustrates satellite-detected damage density in the city of
  Hama, Hama Governorate, Syria. Using satellite imagery acquired 05 March 2014, 26
  September 2013, and 06 August 2010, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 5,224
  affected structures, of which 4,664 were destroyed, 215 severely damaged, and 345
  moderately damaged. This analysis does not include pre-war military bases and facilities.
  This analysis was done as part of the REACH initiative for the U.S. Office of Foreign
  Disaster Assistance. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated
  in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.. [Source: This metadata
  record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original
  dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/damage-density-2014-of-hama-hama-governorate-syria]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

  description: UNOSAT analysts compared multi-temporal satellite imagery (06 August
    2010, 26 September 2013, 05 March 2014) of Hama city to identify structural damage
    through visual change detection. Building damage was classified into three categories
    (destroyed, severely damaged, moderately damaged) and spatially mapped as point
    or polygon features. The resulting geodatabase and shapefile contain 5,224 affected
    structures with damage state attributes.
