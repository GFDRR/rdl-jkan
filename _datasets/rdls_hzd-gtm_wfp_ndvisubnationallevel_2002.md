description: 'This dataset contains dekadal NDVI indicators computed from NASA''s
  Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6.1 from the Aqua
  and Terra satellite aggregated by sub-national administrative units. Included indicators
  are (for each dekad): 10 day NDVI ( vim ) NDVI long term average ( vim_lta ) 10
  day NDVI anomaly [%] ( viq ) The administrative units used for aggregation are based
  on WFP data and contain a Pcode reference attributed to each unit. The number of
  input pixels used to create the aggregates, is provided in the n_pixels column..
  [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted from the Humanitarian
  Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/gtm-ndvi-subnational]'
details: Due to the nature of the Whittaker filter, the update of the timeseries (i.e.
  the addition of a new dekad) has an effect of preceding dekads which diminishes
  going back in time. Therefore slight variations can be expected for a certain number
  of dekads for every update.

  description: Raw MODIS AQUA and TERRA 16-day composite products (MYD13C1 and MOD13C1)
    were integrated into 8-day synthetic products and further aggregated into dekadal
    NDVI indicators at subnational administrative units defined by WFP boundaries.
    NDVI anomalies were calculated as percentage deviations from long-term averages
    to characterize vegetation stress patterns indicative of agricultural drought
    conditions.
