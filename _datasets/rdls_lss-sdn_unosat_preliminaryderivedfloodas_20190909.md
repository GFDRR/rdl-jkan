description: 'UNOSAT code: FL20190815SDN Preliminary satellite derived flood assessment
  in White Nile State, Sudan. [Source: This metadata record was automatically extracted
  from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); Original dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/preliminary-satellite-derived-flood-assessment-in-white-nile-state-sudan]'
details: This is a preliminary assessment and has not yet been validated in the field.
  It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the
  analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that
  only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can
  be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible
  at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban
  areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation
  of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org
  to seek clarification.

    notable changes in surface water extent between pre- and post-flood periods. Inundated
    areas were manually delineated and vectorized into polygon geometries with area
    measurements in square meters and hectares, producing a post-event flood impact
    assessment.
